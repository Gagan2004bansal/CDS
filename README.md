# CDS-Library 

**C Data Structures Library** is a comprehensive library for C, offering a collection of data structures, algorithms, and utilities. It simplifies the use of essential data structures, sorting algorithms, and string manipulations, allowing you to focus on developing your application.

## Key Features

- **Prebuilt Data Structures**: Includes major data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Implements a range of sorting and searching algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Linear Search, and many more.
- **Custom String Utilities**: Provides a custom `String` type with dynamic resizing and various utility functions similar to `std::string` in C++.
- **Custom Functions**: Each data structure and algorithm comes with a set of commonly used operations (e.g., insert, delete, search, traverse) tailored for ease of use.
- **Header-Only Access**: Include the relevant header files in your project to start using the data structures, algorithms, and utilities without additional setup.
